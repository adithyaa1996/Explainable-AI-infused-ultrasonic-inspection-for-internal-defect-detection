This GitHub repository maintains data associated with our accepted paper in CIRP Annals titled "Explainable-AI infused ultrasonic inspection for internal defect detection". 
To briefly summarize,

**1. CNN_with_LIME__Shallow_markers.ipynb** - Script containing the development of CNN classifier model to detect internal markers / defects at shallow depths from the surface of the cube, and the corresponding LIME explanations. The dataset for this model can be found at _markers_dataset_trial.zip_ file.

**2. CNN_with_LIME__Depth_markers.ipynb** - Script containing the development of CNN classifier model to detect internal markers / defects at greater depths from the surface of the cube, and the corresponding LIME explanations. The dataset for this model can be found at _cwm_markers_dataset.zip_ file.
